This is a project similar to Zoom or Meet, in this case is an app than no need a set of steps for login or starting a meeting, just need a login and select a room, as library, meet room, social room or work room, you decide it.

To run this project, I recommend you to create a new project in firebase and to use it as your server because this project, run in my server. Any way, is same cloud platform with Firestore.
